Chrysanthemums
(Dendranthema×grandiflorum)
Chrysanthemums are widely grown greenhouse ornamentals, valued for their vibrant blooms and long shelf life in the floral market. Unfortunately, their lush foliage and tender shoots make them a common target for sap-feeding pests like aphids, thrips, and spider mites. Even moderate infestations can cause visible stippling, curling, or yellowing of leaves, reducing their salability and aesthetic appeal. Because chrysanthemums are grown for visual perfection, even minor blemishes can have outsized economic consequences, making them one of the most “sensitive” greenhouse crops to pest pressure.

In the game, chrysanthemums embody a high-risk, high-maintenance host plant. Their susceptibility to multiple pest types means they often require early and frequent intervention. Players must be strategic about when to invest treatments into chrysanthemums: saving them can yield high rewards, but neglecting them for even a few turns can result in devastating losses to a run.
