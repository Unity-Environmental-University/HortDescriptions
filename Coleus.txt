Coleus
(Solenostemon scutellarioides)
Coleus is a popular ornamental foliage plant, admired for its vivid leaf colors and striking patterns. Unlike fruiting crops, its value lies entirely in its leaves, which makes it particularly vulnerable to aesthetic damage. Pests such as aphids, mealybugs, and whiteflies (though not all appear in-game) feed readily on coleus, leaving behind stippling, curling, and sticky honeydew that mars the plant’s visual appeal. In greenhouses, infestations can spread quickly through coleus collections, rendering entire benches unsellable.

In the game, coleus functions as a “fragile but low-stakes” plant. Because its role is ornamental, its loss doesn’t cripple yield-based scoring the way peppers or cucumbers might. Instead, coleus acts as an early warning system — a host that often attracts pests first, buying players time to intervene before infestations spread to more valuable crops.
