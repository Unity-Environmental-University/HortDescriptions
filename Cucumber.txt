Cucumber plants
(Cucumis sativus)
Fast-growing vines in the gourd family, known for their crisp, water-rich fruits. They thrive in warm, sunny environments and produce yellow flowers that rely on pollinators for fruit development.

There are two main types: slicing cucumbers for fresh eating and pickling cucumbers for preservation. The plants need consistent watering and are prone to pests like cucumber beetles and diseases such as powdery mildew.
