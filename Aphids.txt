Aphids
(family Aphididae)
Small, sap-feeding insects belonging to the order Hemiptera. Characterized by their pear-shaped bodies and often exhibiting vibrant colors like green, yellow, or black, they thrive on a wide variety of plant species. Their primary feeding behavior involves piercing plant tissues with specialized mouthparts and extracting phloem sap, which can stunt growth and transmit plant viruses.

Reproduction in aphids is typically asexual through parthenogenesis – females reproduce without mating – leading to rapid population booms. However, some species alternate between sexual and asexual reproduction cycles. Control methods often involve physical removal, insecticidal soaps, or introducing natural predators like ladybugs to manage infestations effectively.
