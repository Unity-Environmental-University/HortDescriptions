Chrysanthemums
(Dendranthema√ógrandiflorum)
Perennial flowering plants in the daisy family, known for their showy, colorful flowers that come in various shapes and sizes. They thrive in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil.

Chrysanthemums are divided into several types, including garden chrysanthemums, which have large blooms, and spray chrysanthemums, which produce many smaller flowers on branched stems. These plants are susceptible to pests like aphids and diseases such as powdery mildew.
