Thrips
(family Thripidae)
Tiny, slender insects – often less than 3mm long – known for their delicate, fringed wings and ability to fly short distances. They belong to the order Thysanoptera and feed by rasping plant tissues with specialized mouthparts, causing silvery streaks or blotches on leaves and flowers. This feeding can disrupt photosynthesis and weaken plants.

Thrips reproduce rapidly through both sexual and asexual methods, leading to potential outbreaks. Control measures often involve sticky traps, insecticidal soaps, or introducing predatory insects like minute pirate bugs. Monitoring plant health for early signs of infestation is crucial for effective management.
