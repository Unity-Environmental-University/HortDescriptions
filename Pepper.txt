Peppers
(Capsicum spp.)
Peppers are a staple greenhouse vegetable crop, grown for their colorful fruit and culinary versatility. Their tender leaves and stems make them attractive hosts for sap-feeding insects like aphids, as well as thrips and mites, which can damage both foliage and fruit. Greenhouse-grown peppers are especially vulnerable because high humidity and dense plantings create ideal conditions for pests to thrive. For growers, pest damage can reduce fruit yield, deform developing pods, and introduce diseases like Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus carried by thrips.

In the game, peppers represent a crop of medium durability but high consequence. Unlike ornamentals, peppers provide long-term value across multiple turns, but losing them means sacrificing a major source of “yield.” Their gameplay role pushes players to balance defensive investments early, knowing that pests left unchecked can compromise the crop’s payoff later.
