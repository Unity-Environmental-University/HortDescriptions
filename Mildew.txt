White Mold
(Sclerotinia spp.)
A group of fungal pathogens that cause significant damage to a wide range of crops, including vegetables, fruits, and ornamental plants. White mold thrives in moist, cool environments and can infect both above-ground and below-ground plant parts.

Symptoms include white or gray fuzzy growth on infected tissues, wilting, and rotting. The fungi produce sclerotia, which are hard, black structures that allow them to survive harsh conditions and spread to new areas. White mold is particularly problematic in fields with poor drainage or excessive irrigation. Management strategies include crop rotation, selecting resistant varieties, and maintaining good soil aeration and drainage.
