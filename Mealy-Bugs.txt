Mealybugs
(Order Hemiptera, Family Pseudococcidae)
Sap-feeding insects characterized by their distinctive, cottony wax coating. These small, oval insects often cluster in masses on stems, leaves, and buds, appearing as fluffy white or gray patches. They feed by piercing plant tissues and extracting phloem sap, leading to stunted growth, leaf discoloration, and potential viral transmission.

Mealybugs reproduce primarily asexually through parthenogenesis, though some species exhibit sexual reproduction. Control strategies frequently involve physical removal of infested parts, application of horticultural oils, or introducing natural predators like parasitic wasps. Insecticidal treatments should be used judiciously due to potential resistance development.
